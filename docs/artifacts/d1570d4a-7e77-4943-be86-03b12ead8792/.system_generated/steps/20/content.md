# graphify

[![CI](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=v1)](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**A Claude Code skill.** Type `/graphify` in Claude Code - it reads your files, builds a knowledge graph, and gives you back structure you didn't know was there.

Fully multimodal. Drop in code, PDFs, markdown, screenshots, diagrams, whiteboard photos, even images in other languages - graphify uses Claude vision to extract concepts and relationships from all of it and connects them into one graph.

> Andrej Karpathy keeps a `/raw` folder where he drops papers, tweets, screenshots, and notes. graphify is the answer to that problem - 71.5x fewer tokens per query vs reading the raw files, persistent across sessions, honest about what it found vs guessed.

```
/graphify .                        # works on any folder - your codebase, notes, papers, anything
```

```
graphify-out/
├── graph.html       interactive graph - click nodes, search, filter by community
├── obsidian/        open as Obsidian vault
├── wiki/            Wikipedia-style articles for agent navigation (--wiki)
├── GRAPH_REPORT.md  god nodes, surprising connections, suggested questions
├── graph.json       persistent graph - query weeks later without re-reading
└── cache/           SHA256 cache - re-runs only process changed files
```

## Install

**Requires:** [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and Python 3.10+

```bash
pip install graphifyy && graphify install
```

> The PyPI package is temporarily named `graphifyy` while the `graphify` name is being reclaimed. The CLI and skill command are still `graphify`.

> **Windows:** If `graphify` is not recognized after install, add the Python Scripts folder to your PATH: `%APPDATA%\Python\Python3xx\Scripts` (replace `3xx` with your Python version, e.g. `313`). Or use `pipx install graphifyy` which handles PATH automatically.
> **macOS (externally managed):** Use `pipx install graphifyy` if `pip install` fails with an "externally-managed-environment" error.

Then open Claude Code in any directory and type:

```
/graphify .
```

<details>
<summary>Manual install (curl)</summary>

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/graphify
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safishamsi/graphify/v1/skills/graphify/skill.md \
  > ~/.claude/skills/graphify/SKILL.md
```

Add to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```
- **graphify** (`~/.claude/skills/graphify/SKILL.md`) - any input to knowledge graph. Trigger: `/graphify`
When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.
```

## Usage

```
/graphify                          # run on current directory
/graphify ./raw                    # run on a specific folder
/graphify ./raw --mode deep        # more aggressive INFERRED edge extraction
/graphify ./raw --update           # re-extract only changed files, merge into existing graph

/graphify add https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762        # fetch a paper, save, update graph
/graphify add https://x.com/karpathy/status/...       # fetch a tweet

/graphify query "what connects attention to the optimizer?"
/graphify path
